# Joint Astar

This repo provides the c++ implementation of joint-astar for multiple agents path finding.
I wrote this code to find path for multiple robots without any conflict.
It removes edge conflicts as well as vertex conflicts.

Inside this in the folder jointastar integration folder you will find the generic 
type of joint A*. You can integrate it in your projects easily.
